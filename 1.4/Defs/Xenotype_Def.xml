    <description>After the hardy, grayskinned dirtmoles, came the stoneborn. Ever-bearded and short, they mine and forge minerals with a passion few can top, and are able to raise a bastion or core a mountain in a manner of days. Their relationship with rocks and caves comes at the detriment of agriculture, though. And coming from a culture where indecision can lead to death by tunnel collapse, their social interactions are seen as snobbish and rude.\n\nBut in the passages where the insectoids lay claim, the stoneborne reign with their tunnel fortresses, bearing fierce strength and complex engineering.</description>
